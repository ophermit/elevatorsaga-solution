# elevatorsaga-solution
Solution for the elevator programming game (http://play.elevatorsaga.com/)

Solution #1 (elevator_saga_00.js):

This is a sketch-solution which [suddenly] will pass most challenges after a few tries (especially with limited waiting time).
Also, solution does not use the direction indicators. So, solution needs an improvement and i'm working on it.

Some benchmarks (success rate):

1, 3, 5, 8, 9, 16 - 100%

2, 4, 11 - 90%

17 - 70%

7, 12, 18 - 40%

6 - 30%

10, 13, 14, 15 - 10%
